# PCOS-ML-Machine-Learning-for-Polycystic-Ovary-Syndrome-Diagnosis
This repository hosts a machine learning model developed to predict the presence of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in women based on clinical and physical parameters. Leveraging a dataset collected from 10 hospitals across India, the project aims to provide an accessible tool for early PCOS detection.
